// 1. Declare a variable, distance, as Double, using type annotation


var distance:Double

// 2. Declare a constant, maxWeight, as an Int, with a value of 130

// 3. Print out "Your max weight is xxxx pounds", replacing the xxxx with the value of maxWeight. Use String interpolation

// 4. Predict what will happen when you try and execute these three statements?


var x = 15
var y = 25.0

//y = x


// 5. Fix the error in the previous question by modifying the line that reads y = x

//6. Assign 7,300,678,987 to an var bigInt. Use the swift ability to write large numbers so that they are easy to be read.

//7. Write a print statement to print the below pattern exactly
// Note : Only use a single print statement
            /*
                Hello, All
                Welcome to Swift Programming..!
            */


// 8. Consider a point (x,y), Find whether the point is inside or outside the rectangle with lower left corner (lowX,lowY) and upper right (highX, highY).
// Depending upon the cases print "inside" or "outside"

var x1 = 1
var y1 = 2
var lowX = 1
var lowY = 1
var highX = 3
var highY = 3


//using while
//9. print the numbers 1 to N in alternative order, one number from the left side (starting with one) and one number from the right side (starting from N down to 1)

//Decalare var N = 10
//expected output is 1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6

//10. if a number n is given then print the following rhombus
//declare N = 5
//output

// Hint : use terminator  in print statements and loops
