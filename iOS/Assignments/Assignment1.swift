//**************** QUESTION 1 ****************
// 1.a) Declare a variable called  distance of type Double, using type annotation


// 1.b) Declare a constant called  maxWeight of type an Int, with a value of 130

// 1.c) Print  "Your max weight is xxxx pounds", replacing the xxxx with the value of maxWeight. Use String interpolation

//**************** END OF QUESTION 1 ****************

//**************** QUESTION 2 ****************

// 2.a) Predict what will happen when you try and execute below three statements?


var x = 15
var y = 25.0

y = x


// 2.b) Fix the error in the previous question by modifying the line that reads y = x

//6. Assign 7,300,678,987 to an var bigInt. Use the swift ability to write large numbers so that they are easy to be read.

//7. Write a print statement to print the below pattern exactly
// Note : Only use a single print statement
            /*
                Hello, All
                Welcome to Swift Programming..!
            */


// 8. Consider a point (x,y), Find whether the point is inside or outside the rectangle with lower left corner (lowX,lowY) and upper right (highX, highY).
// Depending upon the cases print "inside" or "outside"

var x = 1
var y = 2
var lowX = 1
var lowY = 1
var highX = 3
var highY = 3


//using while 
//9. print the numbers 1 to N in alternative order, one number from the left side (starting with one) and one number from the right side (starting from N down to 1)

//Decalare var N = 10 
//expected output is 1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6 

//10. if a number n is given then print the following rhombus
//declare N = 5
//output

// Hint : use terminator  in print statements and loops

//Strings
//11. Replace the character "a" in original string with # and print the new String
// var original = "This String Contains a very few a's"

//12. Declare 2 Strings str1 and str2 as "Hello, Swift!" and "Hello, World!" respectively and compare them
// If the 2 Strings are equal, print str1 and str2 are equal, else str1 and str2 are not equal. (str1 and str2 should contain values in them)

//13. Declare a String Swift and print them in the reverse order.

//14. Write a Swift code  to check if the first or last characters are 'a' of a given string, return the given string without those 'a' characters in the first and last, otherwise return the given string.
